# Command-line Argument Parser

<a name="introduction"></a>
## Introduction

[![pypi-version](https://badgen.net/pypi/v/ndg.clap)](https://pypi.org/project/ndg.clap)

**ndg.clap** is the command-line argument parser that builds itself.

It is designed to be easy to use by generating most of the boilerplate code
based on function signatures and documentation (stuff you should already be
adding to your code anyway).

This was created as sort of a passion project. It is missing a lot of features
that you would otherwise get from the built-in `argparse` library, but I plan
to add those in as I need them.

## Getting Started

*ndg.clap* has two modes: Application and Script.

Let's start with a quick example for Script. We'll be implementing FizzBuzz
